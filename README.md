# LambTracker-Query-Code
As I've been developing LambTracker I've been creating all my reports and searches by hand with raw SQLite queries. This repository will be the pace I store those queries. Eventually they should all become options within the Desktop modules within LambTracker.

Currently working to clean up teh queries so they are easier to read. This may get all deleted and redone once that work is finished.
